		<p>
			TGM Follows the SEGA rotation system. All of the blocks except I always have a block in the lowest row, and in this way, appear to roll on the ground.<br>
			This might seem unnatural at first, but I think it is easier to use in high speed situations.

		<h2>The Well</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="1pics/kiso01.gif"></td>
				<td>
					The well is a 20 rows by 10 columns field.<br>
					However, as shown to the left, the blocks can go over the uppermost row.<br>
					The stacked blocks as a whole are called the stack.<br>
					The game is over when blocks are forced to overlap.<br>
					Above the well you can see the next block to come.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2>Levels</h2>
		<p>
			Progress in the game is represented by levels.<br>
			The game starts at level 0 and end at level 999.<br>
			For each block to appear the level will raise by 1, Every time you clear lines the level will go up by the amount of lines cleared.<br>
			<br>
			Every level divisible by 100 is the start of a new section.<br>
			To rise from x99 to x00 or from 998 to 999 you will need to clear a line.<br>
			<br>
			Examples:<br>
			- Clearing a line at Lv.99 will raise it to 100, the next block to enter the well will raise it to 101.<br>
			- Clearing 4 lines at Lv.95 will raise it to 99, when the next block enters the well it will still be at Lv.99<br>
		</p>
		<h2>20G</h2>
		<p>
			A frame is calculated 60 times every second.<br>
			The amount of rows a block descends every frame is called a G.<br>
			TGM Has a new mode called 20G in which blocks appear at the bottom of the well.
		</p>
		<h2>ARE/Lock delay</h2>
		<p>
			When blocks fall on the stack there is a brief period before they lock.<br>
			This allows you to move blocks in 20G mode.<br>
			This period is called the Lock Delay and is set at about 0.5 seconds.<br>
			<br>
			There is also a brief pause after a block locks and before the next one appears, this is called the ARE.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>Soft drop/Manual Lock</h2>
		<p>
			You can make a block fall faster by holding the control stick down. It will fall at 1G unless the current speed is higher than 1G, then it will not fall faster.<br>
			If you pull the control stick down while a block is on the ground it will ock despite any lock delays.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>IRS</h2>
		<p>
			IRS Stands for Initial Rotation System.<br>
			If you keep a button pressed during the ARE, the block will appear rotated.<br>

				<td>IRS Can be used to prevent a game over.<br>
				Normal appearance of the S block would have caused a game over by intersecting the Z block. IRS prevents this.<br>
				IRS will be blocked when it would cause a game over.</td>

				<td>According to the table above this rotation should be impossible.<br>
				But, because of an empty space to the right the T will kick the wall.<br>
				Wall kicks, along with IRS make TGM a comfortable series to play.<br>
