		<h1>Lesson 2: Basic stacking</h1>

		<h2>Not too bumpy, not too flat</h2>

				<td rowspan="2">If you make a lot of deep holes, you might die trying to fill them up.<br>
				<br>
					2 block deep holes can only be filled with 3 of the 7 tetrominoes, giving you less than 50% chance to fill them up.<br>
					If there is a block in the way, this can even be reduced to 2.<br>
					When the hole is 3 blocks deep, you can only wait for the I block.<br>
					<br>
					Keep that in mind while stacking.

					Many people build their stack to flat or too bumpy.<br>

		<h2>Learning the colors of the blocks</h2>
		<p>
			I think it is wise to learn the colors of alle the blocks. since the next block is visible at the top of the screen.<br>
			In high speed situations you should be able to recognise blocks by their color.<br>
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="2pics/08.png"></td>
				<td><img src="2pics/09.png"></td>
				<td>S and Z are very commonly used to fill holes of 2 columns wide.<br>
				<br>
				The T block can be used to alternate between S and Z.<br></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="2pics/10.png"></td>
				<td><img src="2pics/11.png"></td>
				<td>J and L can be used for the same purpose.<br>
				But in this case the I is used to alternate between them.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2>Reading the block flow</h2>
		<p>
			The TGM games have a balanced block flow.<br>
			It is unlikely to get the same block multiple times in a row, so you can use this to know when to expect a block.

					When placing a T like here you should pay attention to the upcoming block.<br>

					You should also pay attention to upcoming S and Z blocks.<br>
					Given the upcoming S, we should place the I to the left.<br>
					You should always consider both the S and Z blocks.<br>
					<br>
					In this case we can lean a Z block against the J on the right, or we can fit it in the hole to the left.
