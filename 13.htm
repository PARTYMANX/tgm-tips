		<h1>Lesson 13: Master M</h1>
		<hr>
		<p><h2>Overview of master mode</h2>
		<p>
			From LV.0 - 499 the speeds are about equal to those of TGM.<br>
			From Lv.500 the DAS and Clear animation decrease in length.<br>
			From Lv.600 the ARE after line clear and the line clear animation decrease in length.<br>
			From Lv.700 these continue to decrease, the ARE decreases too.<br>
			From Lv.800 the ARE decreases more, as does the line clear ARE and the line clear animation.<br>
			From Lv.900 the DAS and lock delay shorten. The lock delay almost halves.<br>
		</p>
		<h2>Lv.900+</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>

				<td><img src="13pics/02.png"></td>
				<td>
					The lock delay nearly halves at Lv.900.<br>
					<br>
					This makes simple moves like these impossible unless you have a strongly pyramid shaped stack.<br>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h2>Staff roll</h2>
		<p>
			The staffroll in TAP master mode is an invisible 20G challenge at the speed the master mode ended.<br>
			Blocks disappear as soon as they lock.<br>
			<br>
			The clearing of this challenge is only needed for a Gm rank.
		</p>
		<h2>m Grade requirements.</h2>
		<p>The grade data in the original guide were old and inaccurate, instead look <a href="http://harddrop.com/wiki/index.php?title=TGM2" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
		<h2>Zanghi moves</h2>
		<p>
			A hord drop in TAP does not lock you piece, you need to press down for that.<br>
			because of that you can drop, shift one place to the left or right, and then lock very easily with a smooth 180 degrees turn of the joystick.<br>
			This is called a zanghi move.
