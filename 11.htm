		<h1>Lesson 11: Time attack</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Getting the GM rank.</h2>
		<p>
			To get the GM rank you have to play quick, there are 2 cutoff points.<br>
			You need to finish the game with 126.000 point and a time of 13:30:00 or less.<br>
			You also need to have rank 1 by level 300 and rank S4 in less than 7:00:00 by level 500.

			The ARE in TGM is 0.7 seconds long.<br>
			A line clear takes 0.68 seconds. Singles take as long as tetrisses.

		<h2>Charging DAS</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="11pics/15.gif"></td>
				<td>
					You can charge the DAS during the ARE, however it can be difficult to use.<br>
					For example you can shift a block too far if you're not careful, or you can actually charge a block you didn't want to if you had to charge a series of blocks.<br>
					In TGM the input of the joystick is dropped if it has been held for too long.<br>
					<br>
					DAS can be very useful at high speeds but it has its risks.
