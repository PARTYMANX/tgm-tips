		<h1>Lesson 5: Fast falling stages</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			From Lv.300 speed will increase to 2G and 4G, from Lv.400 it will increase to 5G and end with 3G.<br>
			As mentioned in <a href="1.htm">lesson 1</a> a G is the amount of rows dropped per frame.<br>
			Here are the trajectories for 2 to 5G.

		<h2>Lock delay</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="5pics/02.gif"></td>
				<td>
					When you have to slide blocks you use the lock delay mechanism.<br>
					You have 0.5 seconds to set your piece except if it drops down another line, then the lock delay will be reset.<br></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="5pics/05.gif"></td>
				<td>
					You have to be aware that you can still move a block before the lock delay runs out.<br>
					Like this, you can accidentally move a piece while you are preparing for the next block during the ARE.</td>
