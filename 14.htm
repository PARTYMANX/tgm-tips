		<h1>Lesson 14: Death m</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Death mode overview</h2>
		<p>
			Death mode starts at speeds similar to the ending of master mode.
			During the run from Lv.1 to 900 the delays shorten every section.
		</p>
		<p>
			The torikan moment in death mode is at LV.500 if you reach it with more than 03:25:00 on the clock.<br>
			You will need to finish up to Lv.999 for the Gm rank.

					Starting from LV.300 the ARE becomes extremely short which means you'll have to time your IRS input well.<br>
					If the current block has not yet locked, you could easily rotate it by accident.<br>
					You should release the rotate button as soon as you have rotated, but keep youself ready to hit it again as soon as the block locks.</font><br>
					<br>
					In this example:<br>
					You shift the O to the left and wait for it to lock and then hold A.<br>
					Rotate the L again while shifting to the left and then hold A.<br>
					You shift the S to the right against the obstruction and rotate against it.<br>
					This leaves room to IRS the I into position.

		<h2>Manual locking, compromises and skimming</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="14pics/02.gif"></td>
				<td>
					To get to Lv.500 before 03:25:00, you should get to Lv.300 in about 2 minutes.<br>
					Manual locking changes in Lv.300 since the ARE is too short to effectively do so.<br>
					Therefore you should play as fast as possible in early death mode.<br>
					<br>
					As seen in <a href="11.htm">Lesson 11</a> manual locking is a great way to save time.<br>
					In death you goal is not to clear only tetrisses, but to keep 2 columns open to the right so that you have many possibilities.<br>
					You should also aim to form the stack in a rightwards sloping slope.<br>

					While it is in your best interests to keep a hole free terrain, these are cases where doing so would impede movement.<br>
					In these cases we leave some easy to fixe holes so thet or possibilities of movement are still the same.

		<h2>IRS after manual locking</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="14pics/06.gif"></td>
				<td>
					To be able to get a good time and a nice rhythm in your game, you have to be able to use IRS after you manual lock a piece into play.<br>
					However, the ARE will become exteremly short nearing the end of death mode.<br>
					Lv.300 will feel slow compared to later levels, where if you hesitate even a little bit, the block will lock.<br>
					<br>
					What matters is to stack blocks on the left and clear lines on the right.<br>
					<br>
					Do keep an eye out for dangerous situations though. And do not try to be foolish and wait as long as possible to clear lines.
