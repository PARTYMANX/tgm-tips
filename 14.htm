<p><font size="-1">Death mode starts at speeds similar to the ending of master mode.
During the run from Lv.1 to 900 the delays shorten every section.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The torikan moment in death mode is at LV.500 if you reach it with more than 03:25:00 on the clock.<br>
You will need to finish up to Lv.999 for the Gm rank.</font></p>

      <td><font size="-1">Starting from LV.300 the ARE becomes extremely short which means you'll have to time your IRS input well.<br>
      If the current block has not yet locked, you could easily rotate it by accident.<br>
      You should release the rotate button as soon as you have rotated, but keep youself ready to hit it again as soon as the block locks.</font><br>
      <font size="-1"><br>
      In this example:<br>
      You shift the O to the left and wait for it to lock and then hold A.<br>
      Rotate the L again while shifting to the left and then hold A.<br>
      You shift the S to the right against the obstruction and rotate against it.<br>
      This leaves room to IRS the I into position.</font></td>

      <td><font size="-1">To get to Lv.500 before 03:25:00, you should get to Lv.300 in about 2 minutes.<br>
      Manual locking changes in Lv.300 since the ARE is too short to effectively do so.<br>
      Therefore you should play as fast as possible in early death mode.<br>
      <br>
      As seen in <a href="11.htm">Lesson 11</a> manual locking is a great way to save time.<br>
      In death you goal is not to clear only tetrisses, but to keep 2 columns open to the right so that you have many possibilities.<br>
      You should also aim to form the stack in a rightwards sloping slope.</font><br>

      However, the ARE will become exteremly short nearing the end of death mode.<br>
      Lv.300 will feel slow compared to later levels, where if you hesitate even a little bit, the block will lock.<br>
      <br>
      What matters is to stack blocks on the left and clear lines on the right.<br>
      <br>
      Do keep an eye out for dangerous situations though. And do not try to be foolish and wait as long as possible to clear lines.</font></td>
