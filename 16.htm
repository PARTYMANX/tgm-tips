		<p><a href="14.htm">Lesson 14</a> mentioned that the master mode staff roll is very difficult because blocks disappear as they lock.<br>
		You basically need to remember the terrain, and keep that up for about one minute.<br>

					Your strategy should be to learn the terrain the best you can.  However, you mustn't make it hard on yourself.<br>
					<br>
					In normal play, one should try to save up for a tetris, in the staff roll however, you should try to fill the terrain as effectively as possible, as shown here.<br>
					<br>
					Even when doing this, remembering the terrain is pretty hard to do.<br>

					In normal play you try to keep holes to a minimum, but during the staff roll it is important to pay attention to the landscape in general.<br>
